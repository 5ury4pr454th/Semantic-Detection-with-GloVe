  principle    entropy source measure information  basically  source codes try reduce redundancy present source  represent source fewer bits carry information data compression explicitly tries minimize average length messages according particular assumed probability model called entropy encoding various techniques used source coding schemes try achieve limit entropy source  c x    h x   h x  entropy source  bitrate    c x  bitrate compression  in particular  source coding scheme better entropy source     example    facsimile transmission uses simple run length code  source coding removes data superfluous need transmitter  decreasing bandwidth required transmission    channel coding   the purpose channel coding theory find codes transmit quickly  contain many valid code words correct least detect many errors  while mutually exclusive  performance areas trade off  so  different codes optimal different applications  the needed properties code mainly depend probability errors happening transmission  in typical cd  impairment mainly dust scratches cds use cross-interleaved reed solomon coding spread data disk although good code  simple repeat code serve understandable example  suppose take block data bits  representing sound  send three times  at receiver examine three repetitions bit bit take majority vote  the twist merely send bits order  we interleave them  the block data bits first divided   smaller blocks  then cycle block send one bit first  second  etc  this done three times spread data surface disk  in context simple repeat code  may appear effective  however  powerful codes known effective correcting  burst  error scratch dust spot interleaving technique used other codes appropriate different applications  deep space communications limited thermal noise receiver continuous nature bursty nature  likewise  narrowband modems limited noise  present telephone network also modeled better continuous disturbance  cell phones subject rapid fading  the high frequencies used cause rapid fading signal even receiver moved inches  again class channel codes designed combat fading     linear codes    the term algebraic coding theory denotes sub-field coding theory properties codes expressed algebraic terms researched algebraic coding theory basically divided two major types codes linear block codesconvolutional codesit analyzes following three properties code   mainly code word lengthtotal number valid code wordsthe minimum distance two valid code words  using mainly hamming distance  sometimes also distances like lee distance     linear block codes     linear block codes property linearity  i e  sum two codewords also code word  applied source bits blocks  hence name linear block codes  there block codes linear  difficult prove code

codesreed muller codesperfect codesblock codes tied sphere packing problem  received attention years  in two dimensions  easy visualize  take bunch pennies flat table push together  the result hexagon pattern like bee nest  but block codes rely dimensions cannot easily visualized  the powerful         golay code used deep space communications uses    dimensions  if used binary code  usually  dimensions refer length codeword defined above the theory coding uses n-dimensional sphere model  for example  many pennies packed circle tabletop    dimensions  many marbles packed globe  other considerations enter choice code  for example  hexagon packing constraint rectangular box leave empty space corners  as dimensions get larger  percentage empty space grows smaller  but certain dimensions  packing uses space codes so-called  perfect  codes  the nontrivial useful perfect codes distance-  hamming codes parameters satisfying   r       r       r                binary          ternary golay codes another code property number neighbors single codeword may have again  consider pennies example  first pack pennies rectangular grid  each penny   near neighbors    corners farther away   in hexagon  penny   near neighbors  when increase dimensions  number near neighbors increases rapidly   the result number ways noise make receiver choose neighbor  hence error  grows well  this fundamental limitation block codes  indeed codes  it may harder cause error single neighbor  number neighbors large enough total error probability actually suffers properties linear block codes used many applications   for example  syndrome-coset uniqueness property linear block codes used trellis shaping  one best-known shaping codes      convolutional codes     the idea behind convolutional code make every codeword symbol weighted sum various input message symbols  this like convolution used lti systems find output system  know input impulse response so generally find output system convolutional encoder  convolution input bit  states convolution encoder  registers fundamentally  convolutional codes offer protection noise equivalent block code  in many cases  generally offer

complement relative x  as aside  historically x required nonempty well exclude degenerate one-element boolean algebra  one exception rule boolean algebras satisfy equations since degenerate algebra satisfies every equation  however exclusion conflicts preferred purely equational definition  boolean algebra   way rule one-element algebra using equations        count  negated equation  hence modern authors allow degenerate boolean algebra let x empty  example    the power set  x x  consisting subsets x  here x may set  empty  finite  infinite  even uncountable example    the empty set x  this two-element algebra shows concrete boolean algebra finite even consists subsets infinite set  it seen every field subsets x must contain empty set x  hence smaller example possible  degenerate algebra obtained taking x empty make empty set x coincide example    the set finite cofinite sets integers  cofinite set one omitting finitely many integers  this clearly closed complement  closed union union cofinite set set cofinite  union two finite sets finite   intersection behaves like union  finite   cofinite  interchanged example    for less trivial example point made example    consider venn diagram formed n closed curves partitioning diagram  n regions  let x  infinite  set points plane curve somewhere within diagram  the interior region thus infinite subset x  every point

experimental measurements empirical data   in models parameters  common approach test fit split data two disjoint subsets  training data verification data  the training data used estimate model parameters   an accurate model closely match verification data even though data used set model parameters  this practice referred cross-validation statistics defining metric measure distances observed predicted data useful tool assessing model fit   in statistics  decision theory  economic models  loss function plays similar role while rather straightforward test appropriateness parameters  difficult test validity general mathematical form model   in general  mathematical tools developed test fit statistical models models involving differential equations   tools nonparametric statistics sometimes used evaluate well data fit known distribution come general model makes minimal assumptions model mathematical form      scope model     assessing scope model   determining situations model applicable  less straightforward   if model constructed based set data  one must determine systems situations known data  typical  set data the question whether model describes well properties system data points called interpolation  question events data points outside observed data called extrapolation as example typical limitations scope model  evaluating newtonian classical mechanics  note newton made measurements without advanced equipment  could measure properties particles travelling speeds close speed light   likewise  measure movements molecules small particles  macro particles only  it surprising model extrapolate well domains  even though model quite sufficient ordinary life physics      philosophical considerations     many types modeling implicitly involve claims causality   this usually  always  true models involving differential equations   as purpose modeling increase understanding world  validity model rests fit empirical observations  also ability extrapolate situations data beyond originally described model  one think differentiation qualitative quantitative predictions  one also argue model worthless unless provides insight goes beyond

models throughout history  more accurate mathematical models developed  newton laws accurately describe many everyday phenomena  certain limits theory relativity quantum mechanics must used  it common use idealized models physics simplify things  massless ropes  point particles  ideal gases particle box among many simplified models used physics  the laws physics represented simple equations newton

classical physics  special relativity general relativity examples theories use geometries euclidean    some applications   often engineers analyze system controlled optimized  use mathematical model  in analysis  engineers build descriptive model system hypothesis system could work  try estimate unforeseeable event could affect system  similarly  control system  engineers try different control approaches simulations a mathematical model usually describes system set variables set equations establish relationships variables  variables may many types  real integer numbers  boolean values

following examples to apply affine matrix image  image converted matrix entry corresponds pixel intensity location  then pixel location represented vector indicating coordinates pixel image   x    x row column pixel image matrix  this allows coordinate multiplied affine-transformation matrix  gives position pixel value copied output image however  allow transformations require translation transformations    dimensional homogeneous coordinates needed  the third dimension usually set non-zero constant  usually    new coordinate  x       this allows coordinate vector multiplied     matrix  enabling translation shifts  so third dimension  constant    allows translation because matrix multiplication associative  multiple affine transformations combined single affine transformation multiplying matrix individual transformation order transformations done  this results single matrix  applied point vector  gives result individual transformations performed vector  x      sequence  thus sequence affine transformation matrices reduced single affine transformation matrix for example    dimensional coordinates allow rotation origin         but   dimensional homogeneous coordinates

operators each  the first four operators based traditional mathematical set operations the union operator     combines tuples two relations removes duplicate tuples result  the relational union operator equivalent sql union operator the intersection operator     produces set tuples two relations share common  intersection implemented sql form intersect operator the set difference operator  -  acts two relations produces set tuples first relation exist second relation  difference implemented sql form except minus operator the cartesian product  x  two relations join restricted criteria  resulting every tuple first relation matched every tuple second relation  the cartesian product implemented sql cross join operator the remaining operators proposed codd involve special operations specific relational databases the selection  restriction  operation     retrieves tuples relation  limiting results meet specific criterion  i e  subset terms set theory  the sql equivalent selection select query statement where clause the projection operation     extracts specified attributes tuple set tuples the join operation defined relational databases often referred natural join      in type join  two relations connected common attributes  mysql approximation natural join inner join operator  in sql  inner join prevents cartesian product occurring two tables query  for table added sql query  one additional inner join added prevent cartesian product  thus  n tables sql query  must n   inner joins prevent cartesian product the relational division     operation slightly complex operation essentially involves using tuples one relation  dividend  partition second relation  divisor   the relational division operator effectively opposite cartesian product operator  hence name

program work  so compilers split smaller programs made pass source  representation  performing required analysis translations the ability compile single pass classically seen benefit simplifies job writing compiler one-pass compilers generally perform compilations faster multi-pass compilers  thus  partly driven resource limitations early systems  many early languages specifically designed could compiled single pass  e g   pascal  in cases  design language feature may require compiler perform one pass source  for instance  consider declaration appearing line    source affects translation

for example          integer expressions  cannot passed function expects string  stored variable defined hold dates statically typed languages either manifestly typed type-inferred  in first case  programmer must explicitly write types certain textual positions  example  variable declarations   in second case  compiler infers types expressions declarations based context  most mainstream statically typed languages  c    c  java  manifestly typed  complete type inference traditionally associated less mainstream languages  haskell ml  however  many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference  example  c    java c  infer types certain limited cases  additionally  programming languages allow types automatically converted types  example  int used program expects float dynamic typing  also called latent typing  determines type-safety operations run time  words  types associated run-time values rather textual expressions  as type-inferred languages  dynamically typed languages require programmer write explicit type annotations expressions  among things  may permit single variable refer values different types different points program execution  however  type errors cannot automatically detected piece code actually executed  potentially making debugging difficult  lisp  smalltalk  perl  python  javascript  ruby examples dynamically typed languages      weak strong typing     weak typing allows value one type treated another  example treating string number  this occasionally useful  also allow kinds program faults go undetected compile time even run time strong typing prevents program faults  an attempt perform operation wrong type value raises error  strongly typed languages often termed type-safe safe an alternative definition  weakly typed  refers languages  perl javascript  permit large number implicit type conversions  in javascript  example  expression     x implicitly converts x number  conversion succeeds even x null  undefined  array  string letters  such implicit conversions often useful  mask programming errors strong static generally considered orthogonal concepts  usage literature differs  some use term strongly typed mean strongly  statically typed   even confusingly  mean simply statically typed  thus c called strongly typed weakly  statically typed it may seem odd professional programmers c could  weakly  statically

code use object calling specific instance method certain set input parameters  read instance variable  write instance variable  objects created calling special type method class known constructor   a program may create many instances class runs  operate independently   this easy way procedures used different sets data object-oriented programming uses classes sometimes called class-based programming  prototype-based programming typically use classes  as result  significantly different yet analogous terminology used define concepts object instance in languages classes objects composed using concepts like traits mixins     class-based vs prototype-based    in class-based languages classes defined beforehand objects instantiated based classes  if two objects apple orange instantiated

interference misuse  data encapsulation led important oop concept data hiding if class allow calling code access internal object data permits access methods  strong form abstraction information hiding known encapsulation   some languages  java  example  let classes enforce access restrictions explicitly  example denoting internal data private keyword designating methods intended use code outside class public keyword   methods may also designed public  private  intermediate levels protected  allows access class subclasses  objects different class    in languages  like python  enforced convention  example  private methods may names start underscore    encapsulation prevents external code concerned internal workings object   this facilitates code refactoring  example allowing author class change objects class represent data internally without changing external code  long  public  method calls work way    it also encourages programmers put code concerned certain set data class  organizes easy comprehension programmers   encapsulation technique encourages decoupling     composition  inheritance  delegation    objects contain objects instance variables  known object composition   for example  object employee class might contain  either directly pointer  object address class  addition instance variables like  first name   position    object composition used represent  has-a  relationships  every employee address  every employee object access place store address object  either directly embedded within  separate location addressed via pointer  languages support classes almost always support inheritance   this allows classes arranged hierarchy represents  is-a-type-of  relationships   for example  class employee might inherit class person   all data methods available parent class also appear child class names   for example  class person might define variables  first name   last name  method  make full name      these also available class employee  might add variables  position   salary    this technique allows easy re-use procedures data definitions  addition potentially mirroring real-world relationships intuitive way  rather utilizing database tables programming subroutines  developer utilizes objects user may familiar  objects application domain subclasses override methods defined superclasses  multiple inheritance allowed languages  though make resolving overrides complicated   some languages special support mixins  though language multiple inheritance  mixin simply class represent is-a-type-of relationship   mixins typically used add methods multiple classes   for example  class unicodeconversionmixin might provide method unicode ascii   included class filereader class webpagescraper  share common parent abstract classes cannot instantiated objects  exist purpose inheritance  concrete  classes instantiated   in java  final keyword used prevent class subclassed the doctrine composition inheritance advocates implementing has-a relationships using composition instead inheritance   for example  instead inheriting class person  class employee could give employee object internal person object  opportunity hide external code even class person many public attributes methods   some languages  like go support inheritance all the  open closed principle  advocates classes functions  open extension  closed modification  delegation another language feature used alternative inheritance     polymorphism    subtyping   form polymorphism   calling code agnostic class supported hierarchy operating   parent class one descendants   meanwhile  operation name among objects inheritance hierarchy may behave differently for example  objects type circle square derived common class called shape   the draw function type shape implements necessary draw calling code remain indifferent particular type shape drawn this another type abstraction simplifies code external class hierarchy enables strong separation concerns     open recursion    in languages support open recursion  object methods call methods object  including   typically using special variable keyword called self   this variable late-bound  allows method defined one class invoke another method defined later  subclass thereof    oop languages   simula        generally accepted first language primary features

consisting testing every pair terms  costly practicable long sums products  for solving problem  macsyma sorts operands sums products function comparison designed order like terms consecutive places  thus easily detected  in maple  hash function designed generating collisions like terms entered  allowing combine soon introduced  this design hash function allows also recognize immediately

problem  simplest way rewrite systematically  e  e   f  e f  respectively       e  e        f  e f    in words  internal representation expressions  subtraction division unary minus  outside representation numbers a second difficulty occurs commutativity addition multiplication  the problem recognize quickly like terms order combine cancel them  in fact  method finding like terms  consisting testing every pair terms  costly practicable long sums products  for solving problem  macsyma sorts operands sums products function comparison designed order like terms consecutive places  thus easily detected  in maple  hash function designed generating collisions like terms entered  allowing combine soon introduced  this design hash function allows also recognize immediately expressions subexpressions appear several times computation store once  this allows save memory space also speed computation  avoiding repetition operations several identical expressions some rewriting rules sometimes increase sometimes decrease size expressions applied  this case distributivity trigonometric identities  for example  distributivity law allows rewriting

implementations    the frequently used general purpose implementation associative array hash table  array combined hash function separates key separate  bucket  array  the basic idea behind hash table accessing element array via index simple  constant-time operation  therefore  average overhead operation hash table computation key hash  combined accessing corresponding bucket within array  as  hash tables usually perform o    time  outperform alternatives situations hash tables need able handle collisions  hash function maps two different keys bucket array  the two widespread approaches problem separate chaining open addressing  in separate chaining  array store value stores pointer another container  usually association list  stores values matching hash  on hand  open addressing  hash collision found  table seeks empty spot array store value deterministic manner  usually looking next immediate position array open addressing lower cache miss ratio separate chaining table mostly empty  however  table becomes filled elements  open addressing performance degrades exponentially  additionally  separate chaining uses less memory cases  unless entries small  less four times size pointer      tree implementations         self-balancing binary search trees     another common approach implement associative array self-balancing binary search tree  avl tree red black tree compared hash tables  structures advantages weaknesses  the worst-case performance self-balancing binary search trees significantly better hash table  time complexity big o notation o log n   this contrast hash tables  whose worst-case performance involves elements sharing single bucket  resulting o n  time complexity  in addition  like binary search trees  self-balancing binary search trees keep elements order  thus  traversing elements follows least-to-greatest pattern  whereas traversing hash table result elements seemingly random order  however  hash tables much better average-case time complexity self-balancing binary search trees o     worst-case performance highly unlikely good hash function used it worth noting self-balancing binary search tree used implement buckets hash table uses separate chaining  this allows average-case constant lookup  assures worst-case performance o log n   however  introduces extra complexity implementation  may cause even worse performance smaller

negative index values scalar data types like enumerations  characters may used array index using zero based indexing design choice many influential programming languages  including c  java lisp  this

language built csg geometry framework  although restriction reassigning values  values treated constants  led confusion among users unfamiliar functional programming concept functional programming continues used commercial settings    concepts   a number concepts paradigms specific functional programming  generally foreign imperative programming  including object-oriented programming   however  programming languages often cater several programming paradigms  programmers using  mostly imperative  languages may utilized concepts     first-class higher-order functions    higher-order functions functions either take functions arguments return results  in calculus  example higher-order function differential operator                                                              x                displaystyle dx     returns derivative function                     f                displaystyle f    higher-order functions closely related first-class functions higher-order functions first-class functions allow functions arguments results functions  the distinction two subtle   higher-order  describes mathematical concept functions operate functions   first-class  computer science term programming language entities restriction use  thus first-class functions appear anywhere program first-class entities like numbers  including arguments functions return values  higher-order functions enable partial application currying  technique applies function arguments one time  application returning new function accepts next argument  this lets programmer succinctly express  example  successor function addition operator partially applied natural number one     pure functions    pure functions  expressions  side effects  memory i o   this means pure functions several useful properties  many used optimize code if result pure expression used  removed without affecting expressions if pure function called arguments cause side-effects  result constant respect argument list  sometimes called referential transparency idempotence   i e   calling pure function arguments returns result   this enable caching optimizations memoization  if data dependency two pure expressions  order reversed  performed parallel cannot interfere one another  terms  evaluation pure expression thread-safe  if entire language allow side-effects  evaluation strategy used  gives compiler freedom reorder combine evaluation expressions program  example  using deforestation  while compilers imperative programming languages detect pure functions perform common-subexpression elimination pure function calls  cannot always pre-compiled libraries  generally expose information  thus preventing optimizations involve external functions  some compilers  gcc  add extra keywords programmer explicitly mark external functions pure  enable optimizations  fortran    also lets functions designated pure  c     added constexpr keyword similar semantics     recursion    iteration  looping  functional languages usually accomplished via recursion  recursive functions invoke  letting operation repeated reaches base case  in general  recursion requires maintaining stack  consumes space linear amount depth recursion  this could make recursion prohibitively expensive use instead imperative loops  however  special form recursion known tail recursion recognized optimized compiler code used implement iteration imperative languages  tail recursion optimization implemented transforming program continuation passing style compiling  among approaches the scheme language standard requires implementations support proper tail recursion  meaning must allow unbounded number active tail calls  proper tail recursion simply optimization  language feature assures users use recursion express loop would safe-for-space  moreover  contrary name  accounts tail calls  tail recursion  while proper tail recursion usually implemented turning code imperative loops  implementations might implement ways  for example  chicken intentionally maintains stack lets stack overflow  however  happens  garbage collector claim space back  allowing unbounded number active tail calls even though turn tail recursion loop common patterns recursion abstracted away using higher-order functions  catamorphisms anamorphisms   folds   unfolds   obvious examples  such recursion schemes play role analogous built-in control structures loops imperative languages most general purpose functional programming languages allow unrestricted recursion turing complete  makes halting problem undecidable  cause unsoundness equational reasoning  generally requires introduction inconsistency logic expressed language type system  some special purpose languages coq allow well-founded recursion strongly normalizing  nonterminating computations expressed infinite streams values called codata   as consequence  languages fail turing complete expressing certain functions impossible  still express wide class interesting computations avoiding problems introduced unrestricted recursion  functional programming limited well-founded recursion constraints called total functional programming     strict versus non-strict evaluation    functional languages categorized whether use strict  eager  non-strict  lazy  evaluation  concepts refer function arguments processed expression evaluated  the technical difference denotational semantics expressions containing failing divergent computations  under strict evaluation  evaluation term containing failing subterm fails  for example  expression print length                  -   fails strict evaluation division zero third element list  under lazy evaluation  length function returns value    i e   number items list   since evaluating attempt evaluate terms making list  in brief  strict evaluation always fully evaluates function arguments invoking function  lazy evaluation evaluate function arguments unless values required evaluate function call itself the usual implementation strategy lazy evaluation functional languages graph reduction  lazy evaluation used default several pure functional languages  including miranda  clean  haskell hughes      argues lazy evaluation mechanism improving program modularity separation concerns  easing independent implementation producers consumers data streams  launchbury       describes difficulties lazy evaluation introduces  particularly analyzing program storage requirements  proposes operational semantics aid analysis  harper      proposes including strict lazy evaluation language  using language type system distinguish them     type systems    especially since development hindley milner type inference      functional programming languages tended use typed lambda calculus  rejecting invalid programs compilation time risking false positive errors  opposed untyped lambda calculus  accepts valid programs compilation time risks false negative errors  used lisp variants  scheme   though reject invalid programs runtime information enough reject valid programs  the use algebraic datatypes makes manipulation complex data structures convenient  presence strong compile-time type checking makes programs reliable absence reliability techniques like test-driven development  type inference frees programmer need manually declare types compiler cases some research-oriented functional languages coq  agda  cayenne  epigram based intuitionistic type theory  lets types depend terms  such types called dependent types  these type systems decidable type inference difficult understand program with  but dependent types express arbitrary propositions higher-order logic  through curry howard isomorphism   well-typed programs languages become means writing formal mathematical proofs compiler generate certified code  while languages mainly interest academic research  including formalized mathematics   begun used engineering well  compcert compiler subset c programming language written coq formally verified a limited form dependent types called generalized algebraic data types  gadt  implemented way provides benefits dependently typed programming avoiding inconvenience  gadt available glasgow haskell compiler  ocaml scala  proposed additions languages including java c      referential transparency    functional programs assignment statements   value variable functional program never changes defined  this eliminates chances side effects variable replaced actual value point execution  so  functional programs referentially transparent consider c assignment statement x   x       changes value assigned variable x  let us say initial value x    two consecutive evaluations variable x yields        respectively  clearly  replacing x   x      either        gives program different meaning  expression referentially transparent  in fact  assignment statements never referentially transparent now  consider another function int plusone int x   return x     transparent  implicitly change input x thus side effects functional programs exclusively use type function therefore referentially transparent     data structures    purely functional data structures often represented different way imperative counterparts  for example  array constant access update times basic component imperative languages  many imperative data-structures  hash table binary heap   based arrays  arrays replaced maps random access lists  admit purely functional implementation  logarithmic access update times  purely functional data

differences stem fact functional programming avoids side effects  used imperative programming implement state i o  pure functional programming completely prevents side-effects provides referential transparency higher-order functions rarely used older imperative programming  a traditional imperative program might use loop traverse modify list  a functional program  hand  would probably use higher-order  map  function takes function list  generating returning new list applying function list item     imperative vs  functional programming    the following two examples  written javascript  achieve effect  multiply even numbers array    add  storing final sum variable  result  traditional imperative loop functional programming higher-order functions     simulating state    there tasks  example  maintaining bank account balance  often seem naturally implemented state  pure functional programming performs tasks  i o tasks accepting user input printing screen  different way the pure functional programming language haskell implements using monads  derived category theory  monads offer way abstract certain types computational patterns  including  limited  modeling computations mutable state  side effects i o  imperative manner without losing purity  while existing monads may easy apply program  given appropriate templates examples  many students find difficult understand conceptually  e g   asked define new monads  sometimes needed certain types libraries  functional languages also simulate states passing around immutable states  this done making function accept state one parameters  return new state together result  leaving old state unchanged impure functional languages usually include direct method managing mutable state  clojure  example  uses managed references updated applying pure functions current state  this kind approach enables mutability still promoting use pure functions preferred way express computations alternative methods hoare logic uniqueness developed track side effects programs  some modern research languages use effect systems make presence side effects explicit     efficiency issues    functional programming languages

introduce memory leaks used improperly   launchbury      discusses theoretical issues related memory leaks lazy evaluation  o sullivan et al       give practical advice analyzing fixing them however

cross-language inheritance  allowing classes defined one language subclass classes defined language    features   object-oriented programming uses objects  associated techniques structures supported directly languages claim support oop   the features listed common among languages considered strongly class- object-oriented  multi-paradigm oop support   notable exceptions mentioned     shared non-oop languages    variables store information formatted small number built-in data types like integers alphanumeric characters   this may include data structures like strings  lists  hash tables either built-in result combining variables using memory pointers procedures   also known functions  methods  routines  subroutines   take input  generate output  manipulate data   modern languages include structured programming constructs like loops conditionals modular programming support provides ability group procedures files modules organizational purposes   modules namespaced identifiers one module conflict procedure variable sharing name another file module     objects classes    languages support object-oriented programming  oop  typically use inheritance code reuse extensibility form either classes prototypes  those use classes support two main concepts classes   definitions data format available procedures given type class object  may also contain data procedures  known class methods   i e  classes contain data members member functionsobjects   instances classesobjects sometimes correspond things found real world  for example  graphics program may objects  circle    square    menu   an online shopping system might objects  shopping cart    customer    product   sometimes objects represent abstract entities  like object represents open file  object provides service translating measurements u s  customary metric each object said instance particular class  example  object name field set  mary  might instance class employee    procedures object-oriented programming known methods  variables also known fields  members  attributes  properties   this leads following terms class variables   belong class whole  one copy oneinstance variables attributes   data belongs individual objects  every object copy onemember variables   refers class instance variables defined particular classclass methods   belong class whole access class variables inputs procedure callinstance methods   belong individual objects  access instance variables specific object called  inputs  class variablesobjects accessed somewhat like variables complex internal structure  many languages effectively pointers  serving actual references single instance said object memory within heap stack   they provide layer abstraction used separate internal external code  external code use object calling specific instance method certain set input parameters  read instance variable  write instance variable  objects created calling special type method class known constructor   a program may create many instances class runs  operate independently   this easy way procedures used different sets data object-oriented programming uses classes sometimes called class-based programming  prototype-based programming typically use classes  as result  significantly different yet analogous terminology used define concepts object instance in languages classes objects composed using concepts like traits mixins     class-based vs prototype-based    in class-based languages classes defined beforehand objects instantiated based classes  if two objects apple orange instantiated class fruit  inherently fruits guaranteed may handle way  e g  programmer expect existence attributes color sugar content ripe in prototype-based languages objects primary entities  no classes even exist  the prototype object another object object linked  every object one prototype link  one    new objects created based already existing objects chosen prototype  you may call two different objects apple orange fruit  object fruit exists  apple orange fruit prototype  the idea fruit class exist explicitly  equivalence class objects sharing prototype  the attributes methods prototype delegated objects equivalence class defined prototype  the attributes methods owned individually object may shared objects equivalence class  e g  attribute sugar content may unexpectedly present apple  only single inheritance implemented prototype     dynamic dispatch message passing    it responsibility object  external code  select procedural code execute response method call  typically looking method run time table associated object   this feature known dynamic dispatch  distinguishes object abstract data type  module   fixed  static  implementation operations instances   if call variability relies single type object called  i e  least one parameter object involved method choice   one speaks multiple dispatch a method call also known message passing   it conceptualized message  name method input parameters  passed object dispatch     encapsulation    encapsulation object-oriented programming concept binds together data functions manipulate data  keeps safe outside interference misuse  data encapsulation led important oop concept data hiding if class allow calling code access internal object data permits access methods  strong form abstraction information hiding known encapsulation   some languages  java  example  let classes enforce access restrictions explicitly  example denoting internal data private keyword designating methods intended use code outside class public keyword   methods may also designed public  private  intermediate levels protected  allows access class subclasses  objects different class    in languages  like python  enforced convention  example  private methods may names start underscore    encapsulation prevents external code concerned internal workings object   this facilitates code refactoring  example allowing author class change objects class represent data internally without changing external code  long  public  method calls work way    it also encourages programmers put code concerned certain set data class  organizes easy comprehension programmers   encapsulation technique encourages decoupling     composition  inheritance  delegation    objects contain objects instance variables  known object composition   for example  object employee class might contain  either directly pointer  object address class  addition instance variables like  first name   position    object composition used represent  has-a  relationships  every employee address  every employee object access place store address object  either directly embedded within  separate location addressed via pointer  languages support classes almost always support inheritance   this allows classes arranged hierarchy represents  is-a-type-of  relationships   for example  class employee might inherit class person   all data methods available parent class also appear child class names   for example  class person might define variables  first name   last name  method  make full name      these also available class employee  might add variables  position   salary    this technique allows easy re-use procedures data definitions  addition potentially mirroring real-world relationships intuitive way  rather utilizing database tables programming subroutines  developer utilizes objects user may familiar  objects application domain subclasses override methods defined superclasses  multiple inheritance allowed languages  though make resolving overrides complicated   some languages special support mixins  though language multiple inheritance  mixin simply class represent is-a-type-of relationship   mixins typically used add methods multiple classes   for example  class unicodeconversionmixin might provide method unicode ascii   included class filereader class webpagescraper  share common parent abstract classes cannot instantiated objects  exist purpose inheritance  concrete  classes instantiated   in java  final keyword used prevent class subclassed the doctrine composition inheritance advocates implementing has-a relationships using composition instead inheritance   for example  instead inheriting class person  class employee could give employee object internal person object  opportunity hide external code even class person many public attributes methods   some languages  like go support inheritance all the  open closed principle  advocates classes functions  open extension  closed modification  delegation another language feature used alternative inheritance     polymorphism    subtyping   form polymorphism   calling code agnostic class supported hierarchy operating   parent class one descendants   meanwhile  operation name among objects inheritance hierarchy may behave differently for example  objects type circle square derived common class called shape   the draw function type shape implements necessary draw calling code remain indifferent particular type shape drawn this another type abstraction simplifies code external class hierarchy enables strong separation concerns     open recursion    in languages support open recursion  object methods call methods object  including   typically using special variable keyword called self   this variable late-bound  allows method defined one class invoke another method defined later  subclass thereof    oop languages   simula        generally accepted first language primary features

inheritance give rise directed graph inheritance invented      simula used throughout many object-oriented programming languages java  c    php python an inherited class called subclass parent class super class  the term  inheritance  loosely used class-based prototype-based programming  narrow use term reserved class-based programming  one class inherits another   corresponding technique prototype-based programming instead called delegation  one object delegates another  inheritance confused subtyping  in languages inheritance subtyping agree  whereas others differ  general  subtyping establishes is-a relationship  whereas inheritance reuses implementation establishes syntactic relationship  necessarily semantic relationship  inheritance ensure behavioral subtyping   to distinguish concepts  subtyping sometimes referred interface inheritance  without acknowledging specialization type variables also induces subtyping relation   whereas inheritance defined known implementation inheritance code inheritance  still  inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationships inheritance contrasted object composition  one object contains another object  objects one class contain objects another class   see composition inheritance  composition implements has-a relationship  contrast is-a relationship subtyping    types   there various types inheritance  based paradigm specific language single inheritancewhere subclasses inherit features one superclass  a class acquires properties another class multiple inheritancewhere one class one superclass inherit features parent classes  multiple inheritance     widely supposed difficult implement efficiently  for example  summary c   book objective c  brad cox actually claimed adding multiple inheritance c   impossible  thus  multiple inheritance seemed challenge  since i considered multiple inheritance early      found simple efficient implementation technique       i resist challenge  i suspect case fashion affected sequence events  multilevel inheritancewhere subclass inherited another subclass  it uncommon class derived another derived class shown figure  multilevel inheritance  the class a

multilevel inheritance declared follows this process extended number levels hierarchical inheritancethis one class serves superclass  base class  one sub class  for example  parent class  a  two

superclasses  the general form defining derived class the colon indicates subclass inherits superclass  the visibility optional  present  may either private public  the default visibility private  visibility specifies whether features base class privately derived publicly derived some languages support also inheritance constructs  for example  eiffel  contracts define specification class also inherited heirs  the superclass establishes common interface foundational functionality  specialized subclasses inherit  modify  supplement  the software inherited subclass considered reused subclass  a reference instance class may actually referring one subclasses  the actual class object referenced impossible predict compile-time  a uniform interface used invoke member functions objects number different classes  subclasses may replace superclass functions entirely new functions must share method signature     non-subclassable classes    in languages class may declared  non-subclassable adding certain class modifiers class declaration  examples include final keyword java c     onwards sealed keyword c   such modifiers added class declaration class keyword class identifier declaration  such non-subclassable classes restrict reusability  particularly developers access precompiled binaries source code a non-subclassable class subclasses  easily deduced compile time references pointers objects class actually referencing instances class instances subclasses  exist  instances superclasses  upcasting reference type violates type system   because exact type object referenced known execution  early binding  also called static dispatch  used instead late binding  also called dynamic dispatch   requires one virtual method table lookups depending whether multiple inheritance single inheritance supported programming language used     non-overridable methods    just classes may non-subclassable  method declarations may contain method modifiers prevent method overridden  i e

dynamic dispatch allows optimizations inline expansion    visibility inherited members   the following table shows variables functions get inherited dependent visibility given deriving class    applications   inheritance used co-relate two classes other      overriding    many object-oriented programming languages permit class object replace implementation aspect typically behavior inherited  this process called overriding  overriding introduces complication  version behavior instance inherited class use one part class  one parent  base  class  the answer varies programming languages  languages provide ability indicate particular behavior overridden behave defined base class  for instance  c   base method property overridden subclass marked virtual  abstract  override modifier  programming languages java  different methods called override methods  an alternative overriding hiding inherited code     code reuse    implementation inheritance mechanism whereby subclass re-uses code base class  by default subclass retains operations base class  subclass may override operations  replacing base-class implementation own in following python example  subclasses squaresumcomputer cubesumcomputer override transform   method base class sumcomputer  the base class comprises operations compute sum squares two integers  the subclass re-uses functionality base class exception operation transforms number square  replacing operation transforms number square cube respectively  the subclasses therefore compute sum squares cubes two integers below example python in quarters  class inheritance sole purpose code reuse fallen favor  the primary concern implementation inheritance provide assurance polymorphic substitutability instance reusing class cannot necessarily substituted instance inherited class  an alternative technique  explicit delegation  requires programming effort  avoids substitutability issue  in c   private inheritance used form implementation inheritance without substitutability  whereas public inheritance represents  is-a  relationship delegation represents  has-a  relationship  private  protected  inheritance thought  implemented terms  relationship another frequent use inheritance guarantee classes maintain certain common interface   implement methods  the parent class combination implemented operations operations implemented child classes  often  interface change supertype subtype- child implements behavior described instead parent class    inheritance vs subtyping   inheritance similar distinct subtyping subtyping enables given type substituted another type abstraction  said establish is-a relationship subtype existing abstraction  either implicitly explicitly  depending language support  the relationship expressed explicitly via inheritance languages support inheritance subtyping mechanism  for example  following c   code establishes explicit inheritance relationship classes b a  b subclass subtype a  used a wherever b specified  via reference  pointer object  in programming languages support inheritance subtyping mechanism  relationship base class derived class relationship implementations  mechanism code reuse   compared relationship types  inheritance  even programming languages support inheritance subtyping mechanism  necessarily entail behavioral subtyping  it entirely possible derive class whose object behave incorrectly used context parent class expected  see liskov substitution principle   compare connotation denotation   in oop languages  notions code reuse subtyping coincide way declare subtype define new class inherits implementation another     design constraints    using inheritance extensively designing program imposes certain constraints for example  consider class person contains person name  date birth  address phone number  we define subclass person called student contains person grade point average classes taken  another subclass person called employee contains person job-title  employer  salary in defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restrictions  desirable singlenessusing single inheritance  subclass inherit one superclass  continuing example given  person either student employee  both  using multiple inheritance partially solves problem  one define studentemployee class inherits student employee  however  implementations  still inherit superclass  thus  support cases student two jobs attends two institutions  the inheritance model available eiffel makes possible support repeated inheritance staticthe inheritance hierarchy object fixed instantiation object type selected change time  for example  inheritance graph allow student object become employee object retaining state person superclass   this kind behavior  however  achieved decorator pattern   some criticized inheritance  contending locks developers original design standards visibilitywhenever client code access object  generally access object superclass data  even superclass declared public  client still cast object superclass type  for example  way give function pointer student grade point average transcript without also giving function access personal data stored student person superclass  many modern languages  including c   java  provide  protected  access modifier allows subclasses access data  without allowing code outside chain inheritance access it the composite reuse principle alternative inheritance  this technique supports polymorphism code reuse separating behaviors primary class hierarchy including specific behavior classes required business domain class  this approach avoids static nature class hierarchy allowing behavior modifications run time allows one class implement behaviors buffet-style  instead restricted behaviors ancestor classes    issues alternatives   implementation inheritance controversial among programmers theoreticians object-oriented programming since least     s  among authors design patterns  advocate interface inheritance instead  favor composition inheritance  for example  decorator pattern  mentioned  proposed overcome static nature inheritance classes  as fundamental solution problem  role-oriented programming introduces distinct relationship  played-by  combining properties inheritance composition new concept according allen holub  main problem implementation inheritance introduces unnecessary coupling form  fragile base class problem   modifications base class implementation cause inadvertent behavioral changes subclasses  using interfaces avoids problem implementation shared  api  another way stating  inheritance breaks encapsulation   the problem surfaces clearly open object-oriented systems frameworks  client code expected inherit system-supplied classes substituted system classes algorithms reportedly  java inventor james gosling spoken implementation inheritance  stating would include redesign java  language designs decouple

less commonly  layers  abstraction  wherein level represents different model information processes  varying amounts detail  each level uses system expression involving unique set objects compositions apply particular domain each relatively abstract   higher  level builds relatively concrete   lower  level  tends provide increasingly  granular  representation  for example  gates build electronic

language description somewhat self-contained     database systems    since many users database systems lack in-depth familiarity computer data-structures  database developers often hide complexity following levels physical level  the lowest level abstraction describes system actually stores data  the physical level describes complex low-level data structures detail logical level  the next higher level abstraction describes data database stores  relationships exist among data  the logical level thus describes entire database terms small number relatively simple structures  although implementation simple structures logical level may involve complex physical level structures  user logical level need aware complexity  this referred physical data independence  database administrators  must decide information keep database  use logical level abstraction view level  the highest level abstraction describes part entire database  even though logical level uses simpler

 the authors consider overlap terminology  unfortunate     anonymous functions   the term closure often used synonym anonymous function  though strictly  anonymous function function literal without

 free variable yet bound  only enclosing function evaluated value parameter free variable nested function bound  creating closure  returned enclosing function lastly  closure distinct function free

example  program  functions free variable x  bound non-local variable x global scope  executed environment x defined  immaterial whether actually closures this often achieved function return  since

modern  multi-paradigm languages  python rust  closures also frequently used callbacks  particularly event handlers  javascript  used interactions dynamic web page closures also used

closures also use garbage collection  the alternatives manual memory management non-local variables  explicitly allocating heap freeing done    using stack allocation  language accept certain use

bind relative locations memory store values   although relative location binding change runtime  value bound location can  in languages  since closure captures binding  operation variable  whether
